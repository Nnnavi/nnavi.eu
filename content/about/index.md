## about me

Hi everybody!

My name is Ivan and I am from Bulgaria. This is my language learning diaries. I spent many hours in my life learning languages and this is my passion. These diaries are true exercise for me in writing but everything here is true. I am passionate mostly about romance languages
but occasionally I will post some other things about language learning at all. I am not a professor nor a scientist - so I hope my posts to be useful to someone. Also I want to study  Hugo and make my theme.
