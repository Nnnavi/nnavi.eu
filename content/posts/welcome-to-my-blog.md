WELCOME
to my blog

I made this blog with purpose to learn Hugo and to improve my writing in romance languages. I will try to post useful information about my language learning, my techniques and my goals.
I have made some materials during my studies and I will try to post it here or linked it. Hopefully this blog will evolve to something more interesting than boring diary.
I think that would be more useful to write about common problems or techniques in English and in romance languages about my achievements. I will make mistakes but my goal is to learn to write fast and
to use words I have heard in my listenings. Also I will try to write simple and tidy.
Enjoy reading!
