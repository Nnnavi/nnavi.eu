## NEW GOALS FOR 2021!

The awful 2020 has gone. I wish to myself more luck, to be healthy, more support from my friends and more and enough money.

My main goals are:

1) focus on Italian and Portuguese
2) maintain Spanish
3) reading and writing in Spanish
4) preparing for writing and reading in Italian and Portuguese

I think I focused more in Spanish in 2020. Now I have to spend more time with Italian and Portuguese to strengthen them. I want to feel more comfortably when listen/read in Italian and Portuguese.

## CHALLENGES

The great challenges are:
1) to find more materials to listen in European Portuguese
2) to find more interesting listening materials in Italian
3) to find adapted books in Italian and Portuguese
4) to find sufficient time and energy for learning

## PREPARATIONS

1) to use my plan for 2020 - for months after april
2) to make a list of manuals I have to use and to track my progress.
3) make word lists with learned words by topics and textbooks
4) to make a good progress with my grammar notes on Italian and Portuguese.

## RESOURSES

1) textbooks and manuals
2) dictionaries and grammar books
3) internet resources
4) media resources (audio, video, TV, radio, textbook recordings)
