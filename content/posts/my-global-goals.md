# Intro

Yesterday I listen 4 lectures from Polyglot Conference 2016 in Thessaloniki, Greece on YouTube. The lectures were:

1. Lýdia Machová – The Power of Setting Priorities in Language Learning [CC English/Español]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT7dx52wIC8
2. Helen Abadzi - Efficient language learning for all: What your brain needs to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-1oHIneSNw
3. Alexander Arguelles - Language Learning as Mental Exercise and Discipline
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XhIWpN4tDA
4. Professor Alexander Arguelles - Reading Literature in Foreign Languages: Tool, Techniques, Target
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUqME-RTtIs
5. Steve Kaufmann - How many words do we need to know?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AHFL8veIvs

I was eager to listen these polyglots who I follow in YouTube. Actually I was not listened prof. Arguelles before but was read some of his famous posts in HTLAL forum 5 years ago. I like to listen lectures about language learning, techniques and ideas. I am in a period of my life that I have to consolidate my speaking skills, to focus on some weak points and to reach high level in some of them. So I decided - as one of my goals this year - to listen/read about these techniques, to summarize what is useful for me and I agree with and to implement it actively in my language learning practice. I have to say that listening YouTube videos or listening podcasts is relatively new to me as a practice from maybe a year. The basic information about language learning I know from books and HTLAL forum. I prefer to read than to listen but nowadays I feel more confident in listening.

# What I missed

I understand that I made some mistakes. Some of them are:
- I have no system in my language learning (strategy);
- I have no global goals for each language I learnt;
- I have no goals for this year;
- I have no idea how I learn - which techniques I like and use and which does not like

So I take notes during the lectures I think about want can do.  I realized that I have to organize my learning process. I have some goals in my mind for this year but I have to do some other things. So I decide to take these steps:
- Which are my goals for every language I learn;
- Which are my goals for every language for this year and for next months;
- How to measure both my development and achieving my goals;
- What system for language learning is suitable for me;
- How to implement desired language learning system in my everyday life.

And these questions will be my next posts. When I listen lectures I realized that I already use some of their techniques and I agree with some of their ideas. Maybe would be a great point to continue to use some of my habits if they work for me. But before I decide O inevitably have to make a deep understanding of what I am using now and which of these techniques I use, like, dislike. So this diary will help me with this not so easy task but rather boring.

# What I did last four months with Portuguese

I did these things:
- I review what kind of learning materials I have and decide to use 2 manuals at once;
- I was bored from Teach Yourself (although I like it) and continue with 40 leçons pour parler portugais but stuck with it because I had no exercises - only to produce silly sentences. But I focused on pronunciation and try practicing oral and nasal vowels - with the help of https://european-portuguese.info/.
- started to listen massively podcasts - Practice Portuguese (I like it very much) and a bunch of other but tried to focused on European Portuguese and native speakers. I did not want to add another foreign accent on the top of my own.
- continued to read scientific articles about Portuguese from internet and books
