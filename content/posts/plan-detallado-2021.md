## I. 2020 in brief—the results

My main goals for 2020 were making habits of listening, reading and writing. I successfully make a habit of listening every day for 2 hours. However, I started to make a habit of writing but obviously it was more difficult for me than listening. Additionally I started to read a little but not a regular basis.
	As a result I am very satisfied with what I did last year.

## II. What is my final goal

I want to read not adapted novels in my target languages, to read sites and articles in internet. Also I want to be able to speak on my target languages on non-specific and some specific topics.  About writing I want to be able to write in non specific topics and in some specific. Listening is crucial to me. It have to be at a very high level. As a result I want to use my target languages for many things - searching in internet, reading books, watching TV, speaking, learning interesting things about culture, history, art, etc. I want these languages to become part of my life.

## III. My constraints

I have some constraints - I have to work so I have only some fixed time for learning. I am not exposed to foreign language in everyday life. I have no friends/tutors in my target languages, so I don't do conversations. I can't listen audiobooks – I simply fall asleep. Because of this I have to watch and listen instead of only listen.

## IV. My success

	I made a great success with my listening skill. I made listening an everyday routine. I trained myself to "hear" speaking transmitted by phone, TV, etc., which was a great struggle for me. I found a way to watch and listen instead of only listen to avoid sleeping.
	Additionally started to read articles on English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese /a little/. However I continue to read  books in Spanish and English and tried to read in Italian and Portuguese. I couldn't make reading my everyday habit maybe because I read a lot in Bulgarian and I have to plan a special time for reading in my target languages.
	Third, I started to write in all my target languages. I made my site, organize it and put in it links to sites that I use frequently, some of my notes and materials. Also I tried to write in a notebook but I was not consistent. The main problem were:
  * lack of inspiration,
  * I had no idea how to read an article on a specific topic,
  * how to focus on writing and not to be distracted from something else,
  * how to made writing my everyday habit,
  * how to fix time for writing
  * how to organize this time to be maximum efficient,
  * how to start to write clear, understandable and tied up

So I couldn't do much with writing but I made some preliminary preparations for it. I tried some techniques and reached to some conclusions.
	I was thinking about speaking and tried some things.
I don't want to use tutor or language exchange because I have to spend money, to search for a motivated person who wants to speak with me on interesting topics for both of us. I prefer using an old-school teacher /Bulgarian teacher/ who speak my target language and to take classes for some time. I tried pronunciation drills and tried to record my voice to trace my advance. So I understand I have to invest some money for a good microphone and camera, also have to learn to edit voice records. I also tried speaking to myself /I am not consistent enough/ and dreaming /I can't control it/.
How about my grammar drills. I couldn't make enough grammar exercises but I read some grammar materials and explanations and deliberately listen some YouTube grammar lessons for Spanish, Latin, Italian.

## V. Preliminary preparations for this year

I have to do some preparations to start enact my  goals for this year. I have to buy some gear /microphone, camera, maybe some software/. Additionally I have to spend some time for:
	* finding suitable for me software/online software for editing voice and video
	* learning to use this software so to be able to trace my progress of speaking
	* finding software for writing, reading and speaking /partially done/

## VI. My goals for this year

1) Continue listening every day
2) start writing every day
3) start reading in target language every day      /almost done/
4) try to speak in a regular basis

In a conclusion I have to say:

If you set high goals you'll achieve mediocre results.
If you set a mediocre goals you will achieve no results.
